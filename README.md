# SzechwaneseLexicon
A lexicon for standard (Chengdu-Chongqing dialect) Szechwanese.
In the future we will combine different comments provided by scholars. Because the existing pinyin scheme is not a version that can be read by the general public.

[Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.szechwaneselexicon)
Or get it on [Releases menu.](https://github.com/zttofficial/SzechwaneseLexicon/releases) It's a good choice especilly in sometime Play vesion cannot work or under review.

# TODO
Some special characters(located in Unicode CJK area) cannot be found.
